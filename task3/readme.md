# Welcome to Task 3!

 1. Adjust your existing repository to the structure of this one. ( Rename files, create better folder system ).
 2. Make so index.html will load external JS and CSS files.
 3. Download **users** from `assets/users.json` using [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) method.
	 4. All **inactive** (isActive: false) users should be filtered.
	 5. There should be the possibility of filtering users by **gender**.
	 6. There should be the possibility of filtering users by **fullName**.
	 7. Each of the filtered users should be rendered in a personal card ( reuse one you've created before with some adjustments ).
	 8. All user's fields should be displayed in the card ( using CSS trim the **about** field so it will not take more than 3 lines )
